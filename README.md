# BILHR-Red-Blob-following
 Cerebellar model arithmetic computer (CMAC) is here implemented as lookup table,
 which is equivalent to CMAC as neural network
 The pixel coordinates and the states of shoulder joint(right hand) red blob are collected
 for 150 samples for traning.
 
 During up setting of the traning dataset the elbow and head yaw are stiff. 
 That means the NAO robot follows the red blob it sees only with its shoulder joint (2 DoF)
